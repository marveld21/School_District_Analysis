# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
### Maria and her supervisor on the school board are asking us to look into grades of local high schools. Specifically a possible case of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School(THS) and thier 9th graders. We are going to compare the overall analysis of all the schools to the same data set minus THS.

## Results
### Comparing the districts passing percentages does not show any significant change.
